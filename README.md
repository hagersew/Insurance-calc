# InsuranceApp

**InsuranceApp** is premium insurance calculator in the form of web-application.

A premium insurance calculator is a tool that helps you estimate the cost of your insurance policy. It takes into account factors such as your age, location, and insurance type. The calculator can also help you compare different insurance policies.

Premium insurance calculators are a valuable tool for anyone who is looking for or renewing an insurance policy. They can help you find the best deal on your insurance and make sure that you are adequately covered.

Here are some tips for using a premium insurance calculator:

Be honest about your information. The calculator will not be able to give you an accurate estimate if you are not honest about your age, and location.
Compare different insurance policies from different companies. The calculator can help you compare different policies from different companies to find the best deal.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run storybook`

Launches the storybook.\

[deployment](http://localhost:6006/).
